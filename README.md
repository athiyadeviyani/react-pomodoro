# React Pomodoro Timer

A clean Pomodoro timer built using React Native that locks you out of your phone so you can bloody focus for once! Also added an emergency call feature for safety, of course.

<p>
Based on <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-integrate-redux-into-your-application-with-react-native-and-expo-ec37c9ca6033/">this</a> React and Redux tutorial.
</p>


## Changes from the tutorial
- Linear gradient background (thought it would add a more calming and focused effect, instead of the plain black one used in the tutorial)
- Emergency call button (which I thought was very important)
- Minor font and margin changes 

## How the app looks like
